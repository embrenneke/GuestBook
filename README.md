# Guestbook #

There are many guestbook apps, this one is named Guestbook.

[See release announcement here](http://mbrennek.2nw.net/2013/01/guestbook-open-source.html)

It's halfway through a re-write for version 2.0, but not feature complete
or pretty.

Original Guestbook code is under the MIT license.  Third-party code remains
under it's own license.
